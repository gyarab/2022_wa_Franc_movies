      Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\r\n\r\nAfter the 2002 completion
      of Insomnia, Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page treatment for
      a horror film envisioning \"dream stealers,\" based on lucid dreaming. Deciding
      he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and
      complexity, Nolan shelved the project and instead worked on 2005's Batman Begins,
      2006's The Prestige, and The Dark Knight in 2008. The treatment was revised
      over 6 months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009. Inception was filmed
      in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November
      22. Its official budget was $160 million, split between Warner Bros. and Legendary.
      Nolan's reputation and success with The Dark Knight helped secure the film's
      US$100 million in advertising expenditure."

      debut feature, it was designed to be as inexpensive as possible to make. Scenes
      were heavily rehearsed so that just one or two takes were needed to economise
      on 16mm film stock, the production's greatest expense, and for which Nolan was
      paying from his salary. Unable to afford expensive professional lighting equipment,
      Nolan mostly used available light. Along with writing, directing, and photographing
      the film, Nolan also helped in editing and production."

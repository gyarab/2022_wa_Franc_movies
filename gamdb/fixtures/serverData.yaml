    description: Memento is a 2000 American neo-noir psychological thriller film written
      and directed by Christopher Nolan, based on the short story "Memento Mori" by
      his brother Jonathan Nolan, which was later published in 2001.[5] The film stars
      Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, a man who suffers from anterograde amnesia, resulting
      in short-term memory loss and the inability to form new memories. He searches
      for the people who attacked him, raped and killed his wife, using an elaborate
      system of Polaroid photographs, handwritten notes, and tattoos to track information
      he won't remember. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano co-star in the film.

      2006's The Prestige, and The Dark Knight in 2008. The treatment was revised
      over 6 months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009. Inception was filmed
      in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November
      22. Its official budget was $160 million, split between Warner Bros. and Legendary.
      Nolan's reputation and success with The Dark Knight helped secure the film's
